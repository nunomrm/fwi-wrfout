# fwi-wrfout
A set of python scripts that calculates the Fire Weather Index (FWI), from the Canadian Forest Fire Weather Index (FWI) System (https://cwfis.cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/background/summary/fwi), in an efficient way in order to convert wrfout files into output netcdf files with the FWI index and its sub-indices (FFMC, DMC, DC, BUI, ISI). The source code for the FWI calculation is based on the pyfwi project (https://code.google.com/archive/p/pyfwi/).
